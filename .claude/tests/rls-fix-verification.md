# RLS Fix Verification Test

## Root Cause Analysis Summary
The white screen issue was caused by a chain reaction:
1. **RLS Violation**: `player_presence` table rejected upsert due to RLS policy failure
2. **Authentication Loss**: Game start transition dropped anonymous auth session
3. **401 Errors**: Subsequent requests failed without valid JWT
4. **Render Crash**: Components failed to render without data, causing white screen

## Fix Implementation ‚úÖ

### 1. Secure RPC Function Created
- **Migration**: `fix_player_presence_rls_policy` 
- **Function**: `update_my_presence(p_game_id UUID, p_is_active BOOLEAN)`
- **Security**: SECURITY DEFINER runs with elevated permissions
- **Permissions**: Granted to both `authenticated` and `anon` roles

### 2. RLS Policy Simplified
- **Removed**: Problematic write policy causing violations
- **Added**: Simple read-only policy for game participants
- **Constraint**: Added unique constraint on (player_id, game_id)

### 3. Service Updated
- **File**: `src/services/PlayerPresenceService.ts`
- **Change**: Replaced direct `upsert` with `supabase.rpc('update_my_presence')`
- **Logging**: Enhanced error logging for debugging

### 4. Defensive Rendering Implemented
- **PlayerPage.tsx**: Loading states and error boundaries
- **ChickenPage.tsx**: Loading states and error boundaries
- **Removed**: PWA navigation hack that was masking the real issue

## Test Procedures

### Test 1: Basic Game Start (Critical)
**Objective**: Verify no more RLS violations during game transitions

**Steps**:
1. Create game and join as chicken team
2. Add second player as hunter team  
3. Start game from chicken interface
4. **Monitor console**: Should see no RLS errors (code: 42501)
5. **Monitor console**: Should see no 401 Unauthorized errors
6. **Verify**: Both players reach their game pages successfully

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ No `"new row violates row-level security policy"` errors
- ‚úÖ No `401 Unauthorized` errors on presence endpoints
- ‚úÖ No `ion-menu` content element errors
- ‚úÖ No white screen occurrences
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition to game pages

### Test 2: Authentication Recovery
**Objective**: Test resilience when auth state is temporarily lost

**Steps**:
1. Reach game page successfully
2. Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear all for this origin
3. Refresh the page
4. **Verify**: Loading state shows (not white screen)
5. **Verify**: Error boundary may show with retry option
6. **Action**: Click retry or navigate back to home

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner displays during data fetch attempts
- ‚úÖ Error boundary shows user-friendly message if auth fails
- ‚úÖ No white screen or JavaScript crashes
- ‚úÖ Graceful recovery path available

### Test 3: Player Presence Updates
**Objective**: Verify RPC function works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Start game with multiple players
2. **Monitor**: Browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
3. **Look for**: Calls to `update_my_presence` RPC
4. **Verify**: Calls succeed (200 status)
5. **Check**: Database shows updated presence data

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ RPC calls succeed with 200 status
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy violation errors
- ‚úÖ Presence data updates correctly in database
- ‚úÖ Real-time presence works across clients

### Test 4: Cross-Platform Validation
**Objective**: Ensure fix works across all environments

**Platforms to Test**:
- Desktop Chrome
- Desktop Safari  
- Mobile iOS Safari
- Mobile Android Chrome

**For Each Platform**:
1. Complete basic game start test
2. Verify no console errors
3. Confirm smooth transitions
4. Test presence updates

## Console Error Monitoring

### ‚ùå Errors That Should NOT Appear:
```
- "new row violates row-level security policy for table \"player_presence\""
- "401 Unauthorized" on presence endpoints
- "[ion-menu] - Must have a "content" element"
- Uncaught JavaScript errors causing white screens
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Logs:
```
- "üü¢ Starting presence tracking for player..."
- Successful RPC calls to update_my_presence
- Normal React component lifecycle logs
- Loading state transitions
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero RLS policy violations during game start
- [ ] Zero white screen occurrences across all test scenarios  
- [ ] All error boundaries display user-friendly messages
- [ ] Player presence system works without authentication errors
- [ ] Game transitions are smooth and reliable
- [ ] Fix works across all major browsers and mobile platforms

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Found)
1. Revert `PlayerPresenceService.ts` to use direct upsert
2. Drop the RPC function via migration
3. Restore original RLS policies
4. Investigate alternative solutions

## Post-Fix Monitoring
After deploying the fix, monitor for:
- Reduction in error logs related to RLS violations
- Improved game start success rates
- User feedback on navigation reliability
- Performance impact of RPC function vs direct upsert
