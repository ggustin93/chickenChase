# Title: Optimize Performance and User Experience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance app performance, implement dark mode, and optimize battery usage
# Details:
Implement dark mode theme using Ionic CSS variables. Optimize GPS usage frequency to balance accuracy and battery life. Add loading states and error handling throughout the app. Implement image compression before upload to reduce data usage. Add animations and sound effects for key interactions. Create offline support for basic functionality. Standardize styling across components for consistent UX. Optimize Supabase queries and subscriptions for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test dark mode on various screens and components. Measure battery impact with different GPS polling strategies. Verify image compression reduces upload size without sacrificing quality. Test app behavior under poor network conditions. Confirm animations and sounds enhance rather than detract from the experience.
