# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the centralized communication features including notifications, hints, and game event newsfeed
# Details:
Implement game event newsfeed using Supabase Realtime to display game updates to all players. Develop hint broadcasting system for the Chicken role to send information to all hunters. Integrate push notifications for key events (new challenges, submissions waiting for validation, team found chicken). Build newsfeed UI for game events and chicken messages. Create notification preferences settings.

# Test Strategy:
Verify hint broadcasting reaches all intended recipients. Test push notifications for various event types. Confirm newsfeed displays all relevant game events chronologically. Test that only the Chicken can send information to players.
