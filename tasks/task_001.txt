# Task ID: 1
# Title: Improve existing mockups with simulated data and refactor according to best practices
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refine and visually improve ChickenPage.tsx and HunterTeamPage.tsx (renamed to PlayerPage.tsx) components using simulated data to achieve a complete user experience, while refactoring all files exceeding 200 lines according to cursor_rules.mdc guidelines
# Details:
1. Analyze existing ChickenPage.tsx and HunterTeamPage.tsx (renamed to PlayerPage.tsx) components
2. Improve layout and UI of components following Ionic design guidelines
3. Create complete simulated data structures to represent all features
4. Implement user interactions with simulated data
5. Enhance visual components (cards, lists, forms)
6. Add animations and transitions to improve user experience
7. Implement dark mode and game color palette
8. Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes
9. Refactor all files exceeding 200 lines following cursor_rules.mdc guidelines
10. Break large components into smaller, focused components with single responsibilities
11. Extract stateful logic into reusable custom hooks
12. Use Context API for state that needs to be shared across multiple components
13. Ensure proper Ionic component hierarchy (IonPage > IonHeader/IonContent)
14. Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
15. Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
16. Optimize with React.memo() and useCallback() where appropriate
17. Use MockData to load data in components and pages during this stage

# Test Strategy:
Test interfaces on different screen sizes. Verify interactions with simulated data. Ensure all visual features work correctly. Validate appearance in light and dark modes. Verify that refactored components maintain functionality. Test component composition and hierarchy with React DevTools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create simulated data structures for ChickenPage and HunterTeamPage (PlayerPage) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement complete simulated data structures for ChickenPage and PlayerPage components that represent all necessary features
### Details:
1. Analyze data needs for ChickenPage and PlayerPage components
2. Create TypeScript interfaces for data models (chickens, hunter teams, statistics, etc.)
3. Implement static simulated data in separate files (mockData.ts)
4. Include all necessary properties to display complete information
5. Add variations in simulated data to test different scenarios
6. Document data structure and intended use
7. To test: Verify that data structures are complete and consistent by importing them into a simple component and displaying their content

## 2. Improve layout and UI components of ChickenPage [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Refine ChickenPage user interface using simulated data and following Ionic design guidelines
### Details:
1. Integrate simulated data into ChickenPage
2. Restructure layout using IonGrid, IonRow, and IonCol for better responsiveness
3. Enhance chicken cards with images, statistics, and actions
4. Add filtering and sorting components for the chicken list
5. Implement transition animations during loading and interactions
6. Add dark mode support using Ionic CSS variables
7. Optimize display for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
8. To test: Verify rendering on different screen sizes, test user interactions, check visual consistency in light and dark modes

## 3. Improve layout and UI components of PlayerPage (formerly HunterTeamPage) [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Refine PlayerPage user interface using simulated data and adding advanced user interactions
### Details:
1. Integrate simulated data into PlayerPage
2. Restructure layout to efficiently display hunter teams
3. Create detailed cards for each team member with avatar and statistics
4. Implement a summary dashboard of team performance
5. Add animations during interactions (team selection, member details)
6. Implement touch gestures for mobile interactions (swipe, pinch)
7. Harmonize color palette with game theme and support dark mode
8. Ensure visual consistency with ChickenPage
9. To test: Verify user interactions, test responsiveness on different devices, validate correct display of simulated data

## 4. Refactor components exceeding 200 lines [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Apply cursor_rules.mdc guidelines to break down large components and improve code quality
### Details:
1. Identify components exceeding 200 lines in the codebase
2. Break large components into smaller, focused components
3. Extract stateful logic into custom hooks (e.g., useChickenData, usePlayerData)
4. Implement Context API for shared state management
5. Ensure proper Ionic component hierarchy throughout the app
6. Convert any class components to functional components with hooks
7. Add TypeScript interfaces for all component props
8. Apply React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
9. Use useCallback() for optimizing event handlers
10. To test: Verify all components maintain functionality after refactoring, check performance improvements with React DevTools
