# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Game Creation and Join Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the interface for creating new games, setting parameters, and joining existing games
# Details:
1. Create game creation form with all required parameters (zone selection, time limit, etc.)
2. Implement map integration for zone selection using Leaflet/Mapbox
3. Build team creation functionality
4. Develop invitation system with shareable links
5. Implement game joining flow
6. Create random chicken selection algorithm
7. Develop game lobby UI showing participants and settings
8. Add form validation and error handling
9. Break large components (>200 lines) into smaller components following cursor_rules.mdc
10. Create custom hooks for form logic and game creation
11. Use Context API for sharing game creation state
12. Use MockData for development and testing

# Test Strategy:
Test game creation with various parameters. Verify invitation links work correctly. Test joining games as different users. Confirm chicken selection randomization works properly. Validate form inputs handle edge cases. Test component hierarchy with React DevTools to ensure proper component composition.
