# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop session/room joining authentication and game creation functionality for the Admin/Organizer role
# Details:
Connect the existing Home.tsx and AdminPage.tsx to Supabase authentication. Implement session/room joining functionality similar to Wooclap or Tricount for easy game access. Create the game configuration form that allows admins to: define geographic zone on interactive map, set initial pot amount, define maximum participants/teams, select initial challenges from predefined list. Generate and enable sharing of unique game invite code/link. Store game configuration in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test session/room joining authentication flow. Verify game creation form saves all required parameters correctly. Confirm invite links are generated and work properly. Test geographic zone selection on the map.
