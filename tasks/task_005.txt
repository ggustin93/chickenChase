# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core Geolocation and Map Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate map visualization and geolocation services for both chicken and hunter teams
# Details:
1. Integrate Capacitor Geolocation plugin
2. Implement map component with Leaflet/Mapbox
3. Add functionality to display game zone boundaries
4. Create optimized geolocation tracking with battery-saving strategies
5. Implement bar selection interface for chicken role
6. Develop bar visit marking for hunter teams
7. Add location-based validation (proximity checking)
8. Implement caching for offline map data
9. Extract map rendering logic into separate components (<200 lines each)
10. Create custom hooks for geolocation data management
11. Implement Context API for sharing location state
12. Use MockData for location and map testing

# Test Strategy:
Test geolocation accuracy in different environments. Verify map rendering and interactions. Test boundary detection for game zones. Measure battery impact of location tracking. Verify location caching works when offline. Test component rerendering efficiency with React DevTools.
