# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core Geolocation and Map Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate map visualization and geolocation services for both chicken and hunter teams
# Details:
1. Integrate Capacitor Geolocation plugin
2. Implement map component with Leaflet/Mapbox
3. Add functionality to display game zone boundaries
4. Create optimized geolocation tracking with battery-saving strategies
5. Implement bar selection interface for chicken role
6. Develop bar visit marking for hunter teams
7. Add location-based validation (proximity checking)
