# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Basic Ionic React App Structure with Navigation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational app structure with routing, authentication flow, and core UI components
# Details:
1. Initialize Ionic React project with Capacitor
2. Set up routing system with protected routes
3. Implement authentication UI (login, registration)
4. Create navigation components and layout structure
5. Implement Supabase client integration
6. Configure theming (light/dark mode support)
7. Create reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms)
8. Set up state management approach (context/hooks)

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation flow between screens. Verify authentication redirects work correctly. Ensure components render properly on different screen sizes. Test dark/light mode switching.
