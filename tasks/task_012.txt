# Task ID: 12
# Title: Refactor Files Exceeding 200 Lines According to Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically refactor any files exceeding 200 lines according to cursor_rules.mdc guidelines to improve maintainability and performance
# Details:
1. Identify all files in the codebase exceeding 200 lines
2. Break large components into smaller, focused components with single responsibilities
3. Extract stateful logic into reusable custom hooks
4. Implement Context API for state that needs to be shared across multiple components
5. Ensure proper Ionic component hierarchy (IonPage > IonHeader/IonContent)
6. Convert any class components to functional components with hooks
7. Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
8. Apply React.memo() and useCallback() where appropriate for performance optimization
9. Utilize Ionic navigation patterns with IonRouterOutlet
10. Implement slot attributes for proper element positioning within Ionic components
11. Use Ionic lifecycle hooks where appropriate
12. Ensure all components load data from MockData during this stage
13. Apply consistent naming conventions and file organization

# Test Strategy:
Verify that refactored components maintain the same functionality as original components. Test performance improvements using React DevTools. Ensure proper component composition and hierarchy. Validate that all components render correctly across different screen sizes and in both light and dark modes. Check that MockData is properly integrated.
