# Progress: The Chicken Chase

## 1. What Works (Current State - Robust Foundations)
*   **"No Signup" Anonymous Flow:** The entire application is built on a "Wooclap-style" anonymous session model.
*   **Robust Backend:**
    *   **Transactional Functions:** Core logic like game creation is handled by atomic SQL functions (`create_game_and_host`), ensuring data integrity.
    *   **Version-Controlled Schema:** The database schema is now fully managed by version-controlled **SQL migrations** in the `supabase/migrations` directory. This makes the setup reproducible and robust.
*   **Modern Frontend Architecture:**
    *   **Centralized Session State:** The application now uses a **React Context (`SessionContext`)** as the single source of truth for session data, completely replacing `localStorage`.
    *   **Decomposed Components:** Complex pages like the Lobby have been successfully refactored into smaller, single-responsibility components (`TeamSelectionView`, `WaitingRoomView`) and a centralized type system (`src/types/types.ts`).
*   **Core User Flow (End-to-End):**
    *   **Game Creation/Joining:** The flow for creating a game (as a host) or joining one is fully functional, secure, and resilient.
    *   **Real-time Lobby:** The `LobbyPage` works, allowing players to join, see each other, form teams, and leave, with all changes reflected in real-time via Supabase.

## 2. What's Next (Next Immediate Steps from `todo.md`)
The core lobby and session management is complete and robust. The next phase focuses entirely on building out the **actual gameplay** from the Hunter's perspective.
*   **Flesh out the `PlayerPage`:**
    *   Connect the UI to live game data by creating and using a `useGameData` hook.
    *   Implement the live newsfeed/chat.
    *   Display the list of available challenges.
    *   Display the team's score and the game's cagnotte.
*   **Implement Challenge Submission:** Although the backend tables exist, the UI for submitting a challenge from the `PlayerPage` needs to be wired up.

## 3. Current Status of PRD-Defined Features
*   **Game Config/Launch:** Complete. Reimagined as a one-click-creation flow.
*   **Lobby/Team Management:** Complete. Refactored for robustness and maintainability.
*   **Hunter/Player Interface:** **This is the next major focus.** The page exists, but needs to be connected to live data.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks
*   **`PlayerPage` Complexity:** The `PlayerPage.tsx` file is the next "monolith" that will need careful refactoring as we add features, following the pattern we established with the `LobbyPage`.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
*   **Pivotal Decision 1: Anonymous Flow:** The project successfully moved from a user-account model to a frictionless, anonymous session model.
*   **Pivotal Decision 2: Context over `localStorage`:** We have replaced a brittle `localStorage`-based session with a modern and robust React Context, simplifying state management.
*   **Pivotal Decision 3: Backend Logic:** We have moved critical, atomic operations from the client to transactional SQL functions in the database, increasing security and reliability.
*   **Pivotal Decision 4: Infrastructure as Code:** All database schema changes are now treated as code and managed through a migration system, a professional standard.
