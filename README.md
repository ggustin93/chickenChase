## 2. Architecture Overview

The Chicken Chase platform implements a mobile-first PWA architecture designed around real-time multiplayer gaming, anonymous session management, and social interaction optimization.

### How the Architecture Works

When players create or join a game, the system initiates a social gaming workflow: **(1) Game Creation** - Host creates game with configuration parameters and receives unique join code, **(2) Anonymous Sessions** - Players join using localStorage-based sessions without authentication requirements, **(3) Real-time Lobby** - Team formation with live updates across all connected players using Supabase subscriptions, **(4) Role Assignment** - Chicken team (hiders) and Hunter teams (seekers) with automatic role-based interface switching, **(5) Game Orchestration** - Centralized game state management with SQL functions ensuring data consistency, and **(6) Live Synchronization** - Real-time updates for challenges, scores, and cagnotte management across all participants.

The frontend maintains reactive state through React Context and custom hooks, ensuring the UI reflects real-time changes without manual refreshes. The backend uses PostgreSQL functions for atomic operations and Supabase Realtime for instant synchronization across all players.

```

### 2.2 Game State Management

The system implements **Centralized Game State** architecture with PostgreSQL functions:

**SQL Functions Priority**: All critical game operations use PostgreSQL functions (`update_game_status`, `create_game_and_host`) ensuring data consistency and automatic event generation for real-time notifications.

**Key Implementation Patterns**:

- **Atomic Operations**: Game status changes trigger history logging and real-time events
- **Real-time Events**: `game_events` table broadcasts changes to all connected players  
- **Session Persistence**: localStorage-based anonymous sessions with automatic reconnection
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues with manual refresh capabilities
